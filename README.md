This is my first official project ever. It is bad. The code formating is non existent, so much spagetti italians would be proud. But it is a starting point, and for me in 2021, I guess its the best of my ability. I am writing this in 2025, my stock bot program is much better (although that program has its own problems). So yeah, only reason I'm keeping this is because of histoy/memory sake. Not only do I not know if the code works (it never worked 100% anywho), but it was also made on a computer I no longer have, so using it would require a rewrite.
